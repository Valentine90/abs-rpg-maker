<p>A simple yet powerful and easy-to-configure real-time battle system for games created with RPG Maker XP. Its code is lean and clean, making it a great choice for programmers who want to learn about battle systems.
Unlike other combat mechanics, it is not focused on events, which are slow. In this battle system, an arrow heading towards a target is really an arrow, not an event moving very fast.</p>
